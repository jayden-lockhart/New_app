## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Python 3.9 or later installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* MySQL installed and running on your machine.
* Basic knowledge of using the command line / terminal.
* Git installed to clone the repository (optional but recommended).

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP and extract):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayden-lockhart/news_app.git
   cd news
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):

   * On Windows:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Setup

1. **Create MariaDB  database:**

   Login to your MariaDB  server and create the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE news_app_db;
   ```

2. **Update database credentials in `news/settings.py`** if your MariaDB username or password differ:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'news_app_db',
           'USER': 'root',
           'PASSWORD': 'root',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '',
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Install MySQL Python adapter** if not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install mysqlclient
   ```

---

## Running the Project

1. **Apply migrations:**

   Run the following commands to create the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create a superuser** (for admin access):

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to create a user with admin privileges.

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. **Access the application:**

   * Open your browser and go to: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
   * You can login, register new users, browse articles, and newsletters.

---

## Usage

* **Authentication (`accounts` app):**

  * Login at `/` (root URL)
  * Register at `/register/`
  

* **News_app (`news` app):**

  * View all approved articles and newsletters at `/` (root URL, depending on project URL setup)
  * View article and newsletter details, change their content (if authorized), add articles and newsletters.

---



## Troubleshooting

* **MySQL Client Missing Error:**

  If you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mysqlclient'`, install it with:

  ```bash
  pip install mysqlclient
  ```

* **SMTP Authentication Error:**

  Make sure you use correct email and password. For Gmail, you might need to use App Passwords instead of your regular password.

* **Static files not loading:**

  During development, Django serves static files automatically. For production, you need to configure static files properly.

## Docker setup
1. Create a file called “Dockerfile” in the root directory of your project. This file 
should not have an extension). This file defines the environment your app will run 
in. It tells Docker which base image to use, sets environment variables, installs 
dependencies, and copies your project files into the image. 

Dockerfile configuration: 
# Use official Python image 
FROM python:3.11-slim 
# Set environment variables 
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1 
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1 
# Set work directory 
WORKDIR /code 
# Install dependencies 
COPY requirements.txt /code/ 
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt 
# Copy project 
COPY . /code/ 
 
2. Create a requirements.txt. This file lists all the Python packages your project 
depends on. Docker will use this to install the necessary packages inside the 
container. 
 
3. Create a file called docker-compose.yml in the root directory of your project. 
This file defines how to run your Docker containers. It specifies the services, build 
instructions, commands to start your app, and how ports and volumes should be 
mapped. 

docker-compose.yml configuration:
services: 
  web: 
    build: . 
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 
    volumes: 
      - .:/code 
    ports: 
      - "8000:8000" 
 
4. Run the Django App with Docker Desktop 
5.1. Run this command to build your Docker image based on the Dockerfile and 
dependencies: 
 
docker-compose build 
 
5. Run your container and launch the Django development server: 
 
docker-compose up 
 
 
6. Verify Containerization Success 
In Docker Desktop - After completing the previous steps, open the Docker 
Desktop application and check the following: 
1.  Click on “Containers” in the left sidebar. 
2.  You should see your container listed. 
3.  The container should show a green “Running” status, indicating it’s active.
